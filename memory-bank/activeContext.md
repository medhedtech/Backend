# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Finalizing the scaffold of course-service to mirror user-service.
- Implementing security middleware and MongoDB connection.
- Setting up AWS S3 integration and file-upload pipelines.
- Creating core Mongoose models: Bookmark, Note, Progress.
- Configuring centralized logging and error handling.

## Recent Changes
- Security and validation middleware added.
- S3 service implemented with upload/download functions.
- Joi schemas expanded for all models.
- Route import errors resolved; controllers stubbed.
- Shared code moved to `/shared` and re-exported locally.

## Next Steps
1. Implement controller logic for course, bookmark, note, progress endpoints.
2. Add integration and unit tests for core functionality.
3. Create API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
4. Configure CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
5. Refine performance and load testing strategies.

## Key Decisions
- Adopted MVC pattern consistently across services.
- Centralized shared code for reuse and consistency.
- Use AWS S3 for all file storage needs.
