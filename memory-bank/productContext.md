# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Developers building on the learning platform need a centralized, reliable API for managing course content and user interactions (bookmarks, notes, progress). Without a dedicated service, course data handling is fragmented and inconsistent across applications.

## Objectives
- Provide a consistent, RESTful API surface for course-related operations.
- Ensure predictable responses and error handling for client applications.
- Secure data operations with industry-standard middleware and input validation.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Predictability:** Standardized routes and response formats across all endpoints.
2. **Reliability:** High availability and robust error recovery.
3. **Security:** Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection).
4. **Performance:** Efficient data retrieval and file uploads.

## Success Metrics
- 100% coverage of core course CRUD operations.
- <200ms average response time under normal load.
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in audits.
- Developer satisfaction on integration consistency.
